\section*{Overview}
This project introduces a home automation system designed to assist the elderly and physically challenged individuals by enabling them to control home appliances through gestures using an Android application. Utilizing the smartphone camera, the system recognizes gestures and communicates with a Raspberry Pi to control appliances, offering an innovative approach to home automation that emphasizes flexibility, portability, and ease of use.

\section*{Methodology}
The core of our system lies in gesture recognition facilitated by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which processes images captured by the smartphone's camera. These gestures are then translated into commands that control home appliances, such as fans and lights, through a Raspberry Pi. The system supports both gesture-based and web-based controls, providing users with multiple interaction modalities.

\section*{Tools and Technologies}
The project leverages Android Studio, Python libraries such as Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, and hardware including Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, relay modules, and basic electronic components. 

\section*{Objectives}
Our system aims to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Enhance accessibility for those unable to use traditional home automation interfaces.
  \item Provide a flexible and user-friendly alternative to control home environments.
  \item Implement a cost-effective solution for smart home automation.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}
The Gesture-Based Home Automation project successfully demonstrates a novel approach to assistive technology, enabling users to interact with their home environment in an intuitive and accessible manner. It represents a significant step forward in making home automation systems more inclusive.
